### BioCog Prep Notes - Workgroup 4: Other senses and attention

- Attention: The ability to focus on specific stimuli or locations
- Selective attention: The ability to attend to one stimulus while ignoring others
- Distraction: When a stimulus interferes with the processing of another stimulus
- Dvivided attention: The abiliy to pay attention to more than one thing at a time
- Attentional capture: A rapid shifting of attention usually caused by a salient stimulus such as a loud noise, bright light, or sudden movement
- Visual scanning: Movements of the eyes from one location or object to another

-> Broadbent introduces the information processing approach to cognition: Broadbent's filter model of attention
->  **Cherry (1953)**: In an eraly dichotic listening task, Cherry (1953) found that participants can easily shadow a spoken message to the attented ear and can report whether the unattended message was spoken by a male or a female. However, they couldn't report what was being said in the unattended ear. Other dichotic listening tasks confirmed that participants are not aware of most of the information being presented to the unattended ear.
-> Based on results such as these, Broadbent (1958) created a model of attention designed to explain how it is possible to focus on one message only and why information isn't taken in from the other message.
-> Broadbent's *filter model of attention* proposed that information passes through the following stages:
1. *Sensory memory* holds all of the incoming information for a fraction of of a second and then transfers all of it to the *filter*
2. The *filter* identifies the message that is being attended to based on its physical characteristics (e.g. the speaker's tone of voice, speed of talking, accent, etc) and lets only this attended messages pass through to the *detector* in the next stage. All of the other messages are filtered out
3. The *detector* processes the information from the attended message to determine higher-level characteristics of the message, such as its meaning. Because only the important, attented information has been let through the filter, the detector processes all of the information that enters it
4. The output of the detector is sent to *short-term memory*, which holds information for a few seconds and also transfers information into *long-term memory*, which can hold information indefinitely.

-> Broadbent's model has been called a **bottleneck model** because the filter restricts information flow much like the neck of a bottle restricts the flow of liquid. Moreover, the filter keeps a large portion of information from getting through. The filter lets information through based on specific physical characteristics of the information such as the rate of speaking or the pitch of the speaker's voice. Broadbent's model is called an **early selection model**, because the filter eliminates the unattended information right at the beginning of the flow of information, so *before* it is fully analyzed and *before* it is consciously perceived.

**Modifying Broadbent's model: The attenuation model**
-> According to Broadbent's filter model of attention, since all of the unattended messages are filtered out, we should not be conscious of information in the unattended messages. This was tested by Moray (1959) who did a dichotic listening task in which participants were instructed to shadow the message presented to one ear. However, when the listener's name was presented in the unattended ear, about a third of participants detected it.
-> According to Broadbent's theory, the filter is supposed to let through only the one message based on its physical characteristics. In the dichotic listening test, in many participants their name had not been filtered out, suggesting that somehow the unattended message was analyzed to such level that its meaning could be determined. **This phenomenon is also known as the cocktail party effect**.
-> Information presented to the unattended ear is processed enough to provide the listener with some awareness of its meaning. Example: The "Dear Aunt Jane" experiment.
-> Treisman (1964) proposed the **attenuation model of attention**: Selection occurs in two stages. This model replaces Broadbent's filter with an *attenuator*. The attenuator analyzes the incoming message in terms of:
1. its physical characteristics (e.g. pitch, speed)
2. its language (how the message is grouped into syllables or words)
3. its meaning (how sequences of words create meaninglful phrases).

Relevant information is selected but, besides physical characteristics, langauge and meaning can also be used to separate the messages. Treisman proposed that the analysis of the message proceeds only as far as it is necessary to identify the attended message. The attenuator does not have an all-or-nothing character. Once the attended and unattended messages have been identified, both messages pass through the attenuator, but the attended message emerges at full strength whle the unattended messages are attenuated- they are still present, but are weaker than the attended message. The final output of the system is determined by the **dictionary unit** (a process, and not a brain structure). The dictionary unit contains words or concepts, stored in memory, each of which has a threshold for being activated. A threshold is the smallest signal strength that can barely be detected. So, a word with a low threshold might still be detected even when it is presented softly or is obscured by other words.

**Both Broadbent and Treisman's models are called early selection models because they propose a filter/attenuator that operates at an early stage in the flow of information, before actual perception. Other models propose that selection occurs at a later stage of information processing, after all stimuli are fully analyzed.**

**A late selection model**


### Lesson Plan - Workgroup 4

### Clinical Cases Task

Five different groups

- Each group takes 15 minutes to prepare a presentation about one of the following topics:
    • A patient with damage in the ‘what’ pathway of auditory perception
    • A patient with damage in the ‘where’ pathway of auditory perception
    • A patient with amusia
    • A patient with brain damage resulting in abnormalities in nociception
    • A patient with a lesion in the somatosensory association cortex
    
    
- The students should explain the following components in the presentation
    • The damaged area
    • The function of this area
    • The problems of the patient – try to come up with actual test results
    • Possible treatment
    

- During the presentations:
    • The presenters first describe the problem and the possible treatment
    • The groups that are not presenting try to guess in which brain region the damage is located
    • The presenters then give further details about the damaged area and it’s function
    
#### Prep notes

1. A patient with damage in the ‘what’ pathway of auditory perception
2. A patient with damage in the ‘where’ pathway of auditory perception

**Notes together for Qs 1&2**

- The extrastriate cortex is arranged in two streams - dorsal and ventral.
    - The dorsal stream, which ends in the parietal cortex is involved in perception of location ("where").
    - The ventral stream, which ends in the inferior temporal cortex, is involved in the perception of form/objects ("what").
- The auditory association cortex is similarly arranged in two streams:
    - The anterior stream, which begins in the anterior parabelt region, is involved with analysis of complex sounds.
    - The posterior stream, which begins in the posterior parabelt region, is involved with sound localization.

- Damage to the ventral ("what") stream can produce visual agnosias - the inability to recognize objets even though the visual acuity may be good.
- Damage to the dorsal ("where") stream can disrupt performance on a variety of tasks that require perceiving and remembering locations of objects.

- Lesions of the auditory association cortex can produce analogous deficits - impairments of various aspects of auditory perception, even though the individual's sensation of sounds is spared. Inhibiting structures in these pathways results in specific deficits in perceiving "what" and "where" for auditory stimuli. Specifically, lesion on a region of the "what" pathway disrupts the ability to recognize an auditory stimulus, whereas deactivation of the "where" pathway disrupts the ability to recognize the sound's location.

3. A patient with amusia

**Describe the problem**

- **Amusia** is a musical disorder that appears mainly as a defect in processing pitch but also encompasses musical memory and recognition.
- Two main classifications of amusia exist: acquired amusia, which occurs as a result of brain damage, and congenital amusia, which results from a music-processing anomaly present since birth.
- Acquired amusia may take several forms. Patients with brain damage may experience the loss of ability to produce musical sounds while sparing speech. Symptoms may include the inability to recognize familiar melodies, the loss of ability to read musical notation, and the inability to detect wrong or out-of tune notes. Amusia might also include the loss of ability to sing, write musical notation, and/or play an instrument (symptoms vary depedning on the site of lesion in the brain).

**Brain damage**

Different regions of the brain appear to be involved in different aspects of musical perception. For example, the inferior frontal cortex appears to be involved in the recognition of harmony, the right auditory cortex is involved in perception of the underlying beat in music, and the left auditory cortex is involved in perception of rhythmic patterns that are superimposed on the rhythmic beat.

Therefore, damage in any of these areas (e.g. primary auditory cortex, auditory association cortex, inferior frontal cortex, etc can result in amusia - loss of ability to perceive or produce melodic or rhythmic aspects of music.


4. A patient with brain damage resulting in abnormalities in nociception

**Describe the problem**

- **Nociception** refers to the perception of pain. Pain perception is accomplished by the networks of free nerve endings in the skin. There seem to be at least three types of pain receptors (usually referred to as nociceptors). High-threshold mechanoreceptors are free nerve endings that respond to intense pressure, which might be caused by something striking, stretching, or pinching the skin. A second type of free nerve endings appears to respond to extremes of heat and to acids. A third type of nociceptors appear to provide information about the presence of chemicals that produce inflammation.
- Pain appears to have three different percpetual and behavioural effects. First is the sensory component, the pure perception of the intensity of a pain stimulus. The second component is the immediate emotional conseuquences of pain: the unpleasantness or degree to which the individual is bothered by the painful stimulus. The third component is the long-term emotional implications that such pain represents to a person's future comfort and well-being.

**Brain areas**

- The purely sensory component of pain is mediated by a pathway from the spinal cord to the ventral posterolateral thalamus to the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex. The immediate emotional component of pain appears to be mediated by pathways that reach the anterior cingulate cortext and insular cortex. The long-term emotional component appears to be mediated by pathways that reach the prefrontal cortex.
- Painful stimuli activate the insular cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex. Moreover, electrical stimulation of the insular cortext causes reports of painful burning and stinging sensations.
- **Damage to the anterior cingulate cortex** shows us something interesting: People continue to feel the pain but do not seem to recognize that it is harmful. They do not withdraw from pain or the threat of pain. So, it's possible that damage to the ACC will reduce a person's emotional response to pain, while their ability to detect pain remains intact.
- **Generally, the primary somatosensory cortex is involved in the perception of pain, whereas the ACC is involved in its immediate emotional effects - its unpleasantness.** Moreover, changes in perceived intensity of pain are reflected in changes in activation of the somatosensory cortex, whereas changes in perceived unpleasantness of pain are reflected in changes in activation of the ACC.

**Brain damage**

Therefore, damage to any of the above regions can influence a person's ability to experiencee pain.

5. A patient with a lesion in the somatosensory association cortex

(*from 2 different sources* - not from the book)

The somatosensory association cortex (areas 5 and 7) is directly posterior to the sensory cortex in the superior parietal lobes. This receives synthesized connections from the primary and secondary sensory cortices. These neurons respond to several types of inputs and are involved in complex associations. Damage can affect the ability to recognize objects even though the objects can be felt (tactile agnosia).

The somatosensory association cortex is located in the superior parietal lobe (a.k.a. posterior parietal cortex). The highest degree of convergence of somatosensory information occurs in the posterior parietal cortex. Neurons in the posterior parietal cortex are responsive to somatosensory and visual stimuli, have large somatic receptive fields in which responsiveness is based on stimulus context, and are often more responsive to stimulus movement.

**Brain damage**

Cortical damage, particularly in the area of cortex where the posterior parietal lobe meets the anterior occipital and the posterior, superior temporal lobe, can cause neglect of the contralateral side of the world. This typically happens with nondominant hemisphere lesions since this hemisphere appears necessary to distribute attention to both sides of the body. The dominant hemisphere appears to only “pay attention” to the associated (usually right) side of the world. Therefore, neglect usually involves the left side and can be so severe that the individual even denies that their left side belongs to them.

Large lesions involving the posterior parietal cortex and the adjoining superior temporal gyrus may result in an attentional deficit called “neglect”, wherein there is a partial neglect (inattention) to tactile, proprioceptive and/or visual stimuli delivered contralateral to the lesion site. The patient is described as ignoring the contralesional half of her/his body and space. The perception of a "whole" body is lost and the body parts affected may be considered to belong to someone else. Visual stimuli on the contralesional side may also be ignored.
