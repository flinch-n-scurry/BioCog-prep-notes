### 5. BioCog Prep Notes - Workgroup 5: Control of movement by the brain

- The brain and the spinal cord include several motor systems, each of which can simultaneously control particular kinds of movements.
- Walking, talking, postural adjustments, movement of the arms, and movements of the fingers all involve different specialized motor systems.
- Movements can be initiated in several ways: A rapid stretch triggers the monosynaptic stretch reflex, a stumble triggers righting reflexes, and the rapid approach of an object toward the face causes a startle response (a complex reflex consisting of movements of several muscle groups). Other stimuli initiate sequences of movements that we have previousl learned.
- To understand the role of the brain in controlling movements, we will focus on the roles of some specific motor regions of cortical and subcortical structures.

#### Cortical structures

**Cortical structures involved in the control of movement include the**:
1. primary motor cortex
2. supplementary motor area
3. premotor cortex

**Primary motor cortex**

- The primary motor cortex lies on the precentral gyrus, just rostral to the central sulcus.
- Stimulation studies have shown that activation of neurons located in particular parts of the primary motor cortex causes movements of of particular parts of the body. In other words, the primary motor cortex shows somatotopic organisation (i.e., the **motor homunculus**).
- A disproportionate amount of cortical area is devoted to the movements of the fingers and the muscles used for speech, represented by the disproportionately large mouth and hand/finger on the motor homunculus.
- Somatotopic organisation: The primary motor cortex is organized in terms of specific movements of specific parts of the body. Each movement can be accomplished by the constraction of several muscles. **For example**, when the arm is extended in a particular direction, many muscles in the shoulder, upper arm, and forearm must contract. This means that complex neural circuitry is located between individual neurons in the primary motor cortex and the motor neurons in the spinal cord that cause motor units to contract. The commands for movement initiated by the motor cortex are assisted and modified, most notably, by the basal ganglia and the cerebellum.
- Although brief stimulation of particular regions of the primary motor cortex of monkeys caused brief movements of different parts of the body, prolongued stimulation produced much more complex movements. In other words, prolognued stimulation of different zones of the motor cortex caused different categories of actions.

**Supplementary motor area and premotor cortex**

- Two regions immediately adjacent to the primary motor cortex, the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex are especially important in the control of movement.
- Both the supplementary motor area and the premotor cortex receive sensory information from the parietal and temporal lobes, and send efferent axons (never fibers that exit a particular region/that leave the central nervous system) to the primary motor cortex.
- The supplementary motor area (SMA) is located on the medial surface of the brain, just rostral to the primary motor cortex.
- The premotor cortex is located primarily on the lateral surface, also just rostral to the primary motor cortex.

#### Cortical control of movement: Descending pathways

- Neurons in the primary motor cortex control movements by two groups of descending tracts: that **lateral group** and the **ventromedial group**, named for their locations in the white matter tract of the spinal cord.
- The **lateral group** consists of the **corticospinal tract**, the **corticobulbar tract**, and the **rubrospinal tract**. This system is primarily involved in the control of independent limb movements, particularly movements of the hands and fingers. Independent limb movements mean that the left and right limbs make different movements or one limb moves while the other remains still. Independent limb movements contrast with coordinated limb movements, such as those involved in locomotion.
- The **ventromedial group** consists of the vestibulospinal tract, the tectospinal tract, the reticulospinal tract, and the ventral corticospinal tract. These tracts control more automated movements: gross movements of the muscles of the trunk and coordinated trunk and limb movements involved in posture and locomotion.

#### The basal ganglia

- The basal ganglia are a set of subcortical nuclei, and also constitute an important part of the motor system. We know that the basal ganglia are important for the control of movement, as their destruction by disease or injury causes severe motor deficits.
- The subcortical motro nuclei of **the basal ganglia include: the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the globus pallidus**.
- The basal ganglia receive most of their input from all regions of the cerebral cortex (especailly the primary motor cortex and primary somatosensory cortex) and the substantia nigra.
- The primary outputs of the basal ganglia are as follows: **the primary motor cortex, supplementary motor area, premotor cortex (via the thalamus), and motor nuclei of the brain stem that contribute to the ventromedial pathways**.
- Through these connections the basal ganglia influence movements under the the control of the primary motor cortex and exert some direct control over the ventromedial system.

**Connections with cortex**

- The frontal, parietal, and temporal cortex send axons to the caudate nucleus and putamn, which then connect with the globus pallidus, forming a loop. The globus pallidus sends information back to the motor cortex via the ventral anterior and ventrolateral nuclei of the thalamus, completing the loop (**the cortical-basal ganglia loop**).
- Thus, the basal ganglia can monitor somatosensory information and are informed of movements being planned and executed by the motor cortex. Using this information, and other information they receive from other parts of the brain, they can influence the movements controlled by the motor cortex.
- Throughout this circuit, information is represetned somatotopically: Projections from neurons in the motor cortex that cause movements in specific parts of the body project to specific parts of the putamen, and this segregation is maintained all the way back to the motor cortex.

The cortical-basal ganglia loop:
- The links in the cortical-basal ganglia loop are made by both excitatory (glutamate secreting) and inhibitory (GABA-secreting neurons).
- The caudate nucleus and the putamen receive excitatory input from the cerebral cortex.
- The caudate nucleus and the putamen send inhibitory axons to the internal and external globus pallidus ($GP_{i}$ and $GP_{e}$, respectively).
- 
- The pathway that includes the **internal globus pallidus** is called the **direct pathway**. Neurons in the internal globus pallidus send inhibitory axons to the ventral anterior and ventrolateral thalamus (VA/VL thalamus), which send excitatory projections to the motor cortex.
- The **net effect** of the loop is **excitatory** because it contains two inhibitory links. Each inhibitory link reverses the sign of the input to that link. So, excitatory input to the caudate nucleus and putamen causes these structures to inhibit neurons in the internal globus pallidus. This inhibition removes the inhibitory effects of the connections between internal globus pallidus pn the ventral anterior and ventrolateral thalamus. In other words, neurons in the ventral anterior/ventrolateral thalamus become less inhibited/**more excited**. This excitation is passed on to the motor cortex, where it facilitates movements.
- The pathway that includes the **external globus pallidus** is called the **indirect pathway**. Neurons in the external division of the globus pallidus send inhibitory input to the subthalamic nucleus, which sends excitatory input to the internal division of hte globus pallidus. From there on, the circuit is identical to the **direct pathway**. The exception is that the ultimate effect of this loop on the thalamus is inhibitory. The globus pallidus also sends axons to various motor nuclei in the brain stem that contribute to the ventromedial system. The effect of this pathway is to inhibit the motor cortex.
- A third pathway is known at the **hyperdirect pathway**. Neurons in the pre-SMA send excitatory input to the subthalamic nucleus. The subthalamic nucleus sends excitatroy input to the internal division of the globus pallidus. The internal division of the globus-pallidus has an inhibitory effect on the motor cortex, so the hyperdirect pathway inhibits movements.
- The general function of the direct and indirect pathways have long been understood. However, they hyperdirect pathway was recognized much more recently. The hyperdirect pathway bypasses the caudate nucleus and putamen and is thus able to inhibit movements with a much shorter delay that the indirect pathway.
- The hyperdirect pathway is believed to play a role in preventing or quickly stopping movements from being initiated by the direct pathway.
- **Example**: Suppose that you are jogging down a city street. As you approach a crosswalk, you see that the light is red, so you stop running. The **indirect pathway** plays a role in this inhibition of your jogging. When the light turns green, this go signlal is reflected by increased activity of the **direct pathway**. You lean forward and start jogging again. Suddenly, you hear the sound of a speeding car immediately to your left. Quickly, you stop, and watch a car that has just run through the red light pass in front of you. Activity in the **hyperdirect pathway** has saved your life.

#### Neurodegenerative disorders of the basal ganglia

There are two important neurological disorders that affect the brain regions that make up the basal ganglia: **Parkinson's disease** and **Huntington's disease**.

- Parikinson's disease and Huntington's disease both are progressive, neurodegnerative diseases characterized by motor deficits.


- **Parkinson's disease** is charcterized by an imprairment in initiating movement, particularly actions that were previously automatic, such as regaining balance after being bumped on or walking from one point to another.
- The symptoms of Parkinson's disease are caused by degeneration of dopamine-secreting cells in the substantia nigra and subsequeny disruption of the afferent pathways to the caudate nucleus and putamen.
- **Huntington's disease** is characterized by uncontrollable movements and an impaired ability to cease motor movements.
- The symptoms of Huntington's disease are produced by degeneration of GABAergic acetylcholinergic neurons in the caudate nucleus and putamen. The loss of **inhibition** provided by these GABA-secreting neurons increases the activity of external division of the globus pallidus, which then inhibits the subthalamic nucleus. As a consequence, the activity level of the internal division of the globus pallidus decreases, and excessive movements occur.
